An idiot admires complexity, a genius admires simplicity, a physicist tries to make it simple, for an idiot anything the more complicated it is the more he will admire it, if you make something so clusterfucked he can't understand it he's gonna think you're a god cause you made it so complicated nobody can understand it. That's how they write journals in Academics, they try to make it so complicated people think you're a genius.
Plan B? I'm not sucking CIA n***er cock, bitch. Fuck yerself. I have a space alien. Plan B, Fuck you.
You know the secret, the difference between heaven and hell, Is like, doing your work. You feel really shitty if you don't do your work. If you do your work, it's fuckin awesome.
The most important thing in programming is naming.
In TempleOS, my compiler will put together multiple characters in a character constant. We don't do Unicode. We do ASCII--8-bit ASCII, not 7-bit ASCII; 7-bit signed ASCII is retarded.
The IRA is like the NRA, but for computers.  The CIA wants all code in the cloud under their lock and key.  They want to ban compilers and make people think HTML is computer programming.
Jesus said "I will rebuild this temple in three days." I could make a compiler in 3 days.
India ni***er retard doctor.
Yeah, I killed a CIA n***er with my car in 1999. Score one for the good guys.
If you guys have ideas for things to do, let me know. I probably will ignore them.
I have God's official endorsement. I win and the CIA/FBI n\*\*\*ers lose. Just wait. Dumb fuck FBI n***ers.
I report to God. You report to me.
Computers went to shit when they started making them for n***ers.
God's world is perfectly just. Only a n\*\*\*er cannot see. That's why n***ers have no morals.
CIA n***ers glow in the dark. You can see them if you're driving. You just run them over. That's what you do.
God said 640x480 16 color.  That's different, huh!  I get God's official endorsement, though!
Do what you like.  I'll stick to just being God's official temple, how about that?
Guess what?  Mine is God's official temple.
The psychologists like to fuck with me over Bare Metal operating system.  I have proof my compiler was 64 bit before bare metal existed on the Internet Archive. They're fucking with dates.
Microsoft and Intel is like the government printing press of tax code.  They churn-out 1,000 pages a day of tax code.  They are not ashamed.  They are making shitty-ass jobs for people who can spend all day surfing the Internet and robbing their companies because it's all stupid shit.
In India, the rich keep thing inefficent to make jobs.  FUCK YOU!  Just give us money.
There are so many layers built-up.  It's all nerd bullshit and nobody cares. Why would a kid want to do that stupid-ass nerd bullshit?
What's the road ahead for Intel and CPUs?  Think about a thousand years.  I have a hard time imagining a need for digital designers.
Go draw an elephant with 16 colors, then draw an elephant with 24-bit color in MS Paint.  "Ahhh, I am enlightened," you will say.
Download God's Temple Operating System and study it to see divine intellect at work.  It was designed by God, just like Noah's ark and Solomon's Temple and the Bible.
I used to drink when I was young. I would wake-up and think about my shameful behavior and be stoic, I guess. Recently, I've been fighting hard to break-out of my prison. Ten years? Insanity.\n God is perfectly just. Sadly, it's not like I've suffered, exactly. When you get out of control and call people "n***rs", that can't be good. God talks. I'm not exactly believed. Everybody is cruel and give no clue what they make of me.\n God is perfectly just. The countless generations before me? It appears that I get my own little principality of which I sometimes seem supreme.
 was chosen by God because I am the best programmer on the planet and God boosted my IQ with divine intellect.
